# Orphaned File Recovery - Final Summary

## Investigation Summary

### Original Request
Find the migration system location and timing to recover mappings for 72 orphaned UUID files in S3.

### Key Findings

1. **Migration System Timeline**
   - PostgreSQL database removed: July 8, 2025
   - S3 UUID migration occurred: July 13, 2025 at 20:45-20:46
   - 62 files uploaded in batch, 72 files remained orphaned

2. **Discovered Mapping Sources**
   - `sam_torode_s3_upload_502.json` - Contains UUID mappings but for different UUIDs than orphaned files
   - `client_file_mapping_*.json` - Contains client-file relationships without UUIDs
   - `s3_upload_specific_rows_report.json` - Shows failed uploads for rows 503-506

3. **Recovery Results**
   - **Total orphaned files**: 72
   - **Files recovered**: 3 (4.17% recovery rate)
   - **Recovery method**: File size matching with high confidence
   - **Recovered files**:
     - `b3c1246d-7069-442b-bedd-30b7cec403dc.mp4` → `502/Sam_Torode/youtube_M36f9CGC0QY.mp4`
     - `274a60ab-5acf-491b-94a8-3346ba1f2000.mp4` → `502/Sam_Torode/youtube_q2QMw4nGV0A.mp4`
     - `94e58533-dc61-4594-b463-438fa7d7e6f8.mp4` → `502/Sam_Torode/youtube_sV5oH7itRyo.mp4`

## Technical Analysis

### Why Only 3 Files Recovered
1. **UUID Mismatch**: The UUIDs in `sam_torode_s3_upload_502.json` don't match any orphaned files in S3
2. **Missing Database**: The PostgreSQL `migration_state` table was removed before the migration
3. **Limited Unique Sizes**: Only 3 files had unique file sizes that could be confidently matched

### Remaining Challenges
- 69 files remain orphaned without clear mappings
- Multiple files share the same size, making confident matching impossible
- No UUID-to-client mapping records found for the actual orphaned files

## Scripts Created

1. **`deep_migration_investigation.py`** - Comprehensive investigation of migration system
2. **`recover_orphaned_with_mappings.py`** - Initial recovery attempt using known mappings
3. **`execute_smart_recovery.py`** - Smart recovery using file size matching

## Recommendations

1. **For Remaining 69 Files**:
   - Manual review of file sizes and timestamps
   - Cross-reference with original download timestamps
   - Consider content-based matching (video/audio fingerprinting)

2. **Prevention for Future**:
   - Maintain UUID-to-client mapping table
   - Include client metadata in S3 object tags
   - Regular validation of orphaned files

## Recovery Reports
- `smart_recovery_report_20250726_034844.json` - Final recovery results with 3 successful recoveries

The investigation successfully identified the migration system timeline and recovered 3 files with high confidence. The remaining 69 files require additional mapping information that was lost when the PostgreSQL database was removed.

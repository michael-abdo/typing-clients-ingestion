# Remap Scripts and Reports

This folder contains all scripts and reports created during the orphaned UUID file recovery process.

## Recovery Scripts

### 1. `reconstruct_database_mappings.py`
- Searches git history for database references
- Attempts PostgreSQL connection to recover migration_state data
- Analyzes S3 metadata for mapping clues
- Creates comprehensive reconstruction report

### 2. `recover_orphaned_with_mappings.py`
- Initial recovery attempt using sam_torode_s3_upload_502.json mappings
- Loads client_file_mapping JSON files
- Attempts to recover files based on known mappings

### 3. `execute_smart_recovery.py`
- Smart recovery using file size matching
- Correlates orphaned files with client files by size
- Successfully recovered 3 files with unique sizes
- Supports dry-run mode for safety

### 4. `recover_all_from_s3_metadata.py`
- **The breakthrough script!**
- Discovers S3 objects contain complete metadata
- Recovers files using person_id, person_name, and original_key metadata
- Successfully recovered 69 files

### 5. `recover_remaining_orphaned.py`
- Final cleanup script for remaining files
- Processes files in small batches
- Recovered the last 8 orphaned files

### 6. `update_csv_with_all_s3_mappings.py`
- Updates CSV with all current S3 mappings
- Adds missing rows 489 (Dan Jane) and 498 (Carlos Arthur)
- Populates file_uuids and s3_paths JSON fields

### 7. `verify_complete_mapping.py`
- Verifies all S3 files are mapped to CSV entries
- Checks for any remaining orphaned files
- Confirms 100% recovery success

## Reports

### Recovery Reports
- `smart_recovery_report_*.json` - Results from size-based matching attempts
- `metadata_recovery_report_*.json` - Results from metadata-based recovery
- `database_reconstruction_report_*.json` - Database search findings
- `orphaned_file_recovery_report_*.json` - Initial recovery attempts
- `final_recovery_summary_*.json` - Final recovery statistics

### Summary Documents
- `ORPHANED_FILE_RECOVERY_FINAL_SUMMARY.md` - Technical summary of recovery process
- `COMPLETE_RECOVERY_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive final report with all details

## Key Findings

1. **S3 Metadata Preservation**: The migration system stored complete mappings in S3 object metadata
2. **100% Recovery Rate**: All 72 orphaned files were successfully recovered
3. **19 People with Files**: Only 19 out of 485 people had actual media files
4. **108 Total Files**: Distributed unevenly (top 4 people have 63% of files)

## Usage

To re-run any recovery process:
```bash
# Dry run first
python3 remap/execute_smart_recovery.py

# Execute recovery
python3 remap/execute_smart_recovery.py --execute

# Update CSV mappings
python3 remap/update_csv_with_all_s3_mappings.py

# Verify results
python3 remap/verify_complete_mapping.py
```

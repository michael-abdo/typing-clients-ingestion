Name: Ryan Madera Email: ryan.madera27@gmail.com Email used for payment: ryan.madera27@gmail.com City / State / Country: Chicago / IL / United States Have you been typed by us before? No What type (or coins) do you currently see yourself as? I’m relatively certain that my saviors are T and N, but ever since I started watching all of your objective typing videos it’s possible that my original guesses at my type are wrong. Here is the progression of my perspective on my own type over the past few years: 1. INTP for about 2 years 2. ENTP for about 5 months 3. INFJ for about 1 week 4. ESTJ for about 2 days (my psychoanalytic therapist suggested I view myself through the lens of “I am an ESTJ because” as an exercise and oh man did I come to some very weird conclusions about myself) 5. Now, I’m not so sure and could really use some tribe insight (plus I really want copies of the paid materials you guys offer) Do you have any questions for us? I’m sure at least a few dozen people have already asked you this, but do you know who CSJoseph (on YouTube, not the old dead guy) is? If so, what do you think of his videos on typology? Although I’ve come to realize that the overwhelming majority of his content is mostly Ne yapping, I do think there are a lot of insightful observations sprinkled throughout his videos regarding typology as a whole. Evidently, he does not do a spectacular job “respecting the sensory” in the same way you guys seem to do with your clients and with the way you teach your typology system(s), but I still think he makes some meaningful contributions to the tribe’s collective understanding of type. NOT A QUESTION: There is another content creator who has a smaller platform on YouTube with the channel name “Skimmerlit.” He’s a self-identified INTP who I definitely suspect actually is one based on my own understanding of your typing system as well. Although he does go off on Ti/Ne tangents as well, he can be very grounding and validating for other struggling Ti dominants (or at least I found him to be). Honestly, I only bring him up because I think Dave and/or Shanny would have a polarized perspective on him as an individual. Like other Di(s), he does seem to have a very black and white perspective on things that may aid in future additions to OPS’s typing system. Evidently, his flavor of typology is much more heavily coated in the MBTI standard but his Ti has sort of deconstructed the major misdirects that websites like 16Personalities sends people down. ALSO NOT A QUESTION: Obviously, I don’t take personal offense if what I’ve written above isn’t of interest to anyone at OPS, but I wanted to share where most of my personal understanding of type comes from in the event I get the opportunity to talk with any of you directly. I love and admire the scientific approach you’re all taking with this and would love to get involved if you think there is a chance I would be a good fit for your organization’s goals. I hope to hear back from you all soon! FOR DAVE: You’re really funny in the videos and I love how routinely you self-deprecate as a DD. It’s always tasteful and more funny than it is offensive. I hope you channel that energy outside of the content and share that with the people in your personal life. FOR SHANNY: Thank you for being so vulnerable with the tribe and your growth as an individual. I always find your personal anecdotes inspiring and I usually do identify with your struggles and/or know someone else who has gone through what you describe to varying degrees (i.e. you help me understand the people in my own life). Thank you both for creating these silly videos and sharing your ideas with the tribe. I really believe in the work you do and share your channel with anyone who I think would take my suggestion(s) seriously. Paste Your Typing Video Here (see questions below): VIDEO TYPING - Ryan Madera Extra Credit Videos: NA (If the questions have changed, don't worry about it! Just talk for at least an hour) Video Typing Questions TIPS: Tell us stories! The worst thing you can do is answer these questions in a reserved, straight forward manner. Some questions you won't be able to talk much on and that's fine. But some questions will get you processing out loud, and that's what we are looking for. Share negativity and where you are feeling stuck in life. 1) What is your average day/week like? (Wake-up time, school, work, friends, family drama, interests, etc.) 2) Tell us a story about what frustrated you at work this week. 3) Tell us about the 3 closest people in your life. 4) Tell us a story about the person who frustrates you the most. 5) What is wrong with the government and politics these days? 6) Tell us a story about the best and/or worst time in your life. 7) What is the biggest challenge in your life right now? (The point here is to get you talking about what you really care about.) 8) What are some important things you want us to know about you? 9) What type do you see yourself and why? 10) What are you wanting to get out of the typing process? - PASTE ANY OTHER RANDOM PICTURES OR INFO YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE BELOW! - I included plenty of photos in the video. Please do not share screenshots of any of the individuals shown in the pictures (unless it is of myself if you want to reference me as a “sample of my type” in a lineup of photos of people of the same type as me). I’m not sure if I can legally challenge you or anything like that in the event you do considering I very actively have been clicking share button after share button while doing all the things to submit this document, but it would be really cool if we didn’t share things without the explicit consent from everyone shown in the photos.

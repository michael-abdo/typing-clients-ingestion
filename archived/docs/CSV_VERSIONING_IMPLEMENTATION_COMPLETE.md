# CSV Versioning Implementation Complete

## Summary

Automatic CSV versioning in S3 has been successfully implemented and integrated into the pipeline. This addresses your request:

> "plz create a folder for the CSV, and every time we run the pipeline and update the csv with new rows, plz upload the new csv. Please name it by date/time updated so we can easily access the version history."

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Automatic CSV Versioning**
- Every CSV write now automatically creates a timestamped version in S3
- No configuration needed - works automatically when `storage_mode: "s3"`
- Non-blocking - CSV operations succeed even if S3 upload fails

### 2. **Organized S3 Structure**
```
csv-versions/
â”œâ”€â”€ 2025/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ output_2025-01-21_143052.csv
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 07/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ output_2025-07-21_134651.csv
```

### 3. **Files Created**
- `utils/csv_s3_versioning.py` - Core versioning functionality
- `test_csv_versioning.py` - Test script demonstrating functionality
- `list_csv_versions.py` - View and download CSV versions
- `CSV_VERSIONING_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### 4. **Integration Points**
- Modified `utils/csv_manager.py` to automatically upload versions
- Uses existing S3 configuration from `config/config.yaml`
- Works with all CSV operations (simple_workflow.py, download scripts, etc.)

## How to Use

### Run Pipeline (Automatic Versioning)
```bash
# Just run the pipeline normally - versioning happens automatically
python3 simple_workflow.py
python3 download_all_enhanced.py
```

### View Version History
```bash
# List all CSV versions
python3 list_csv_versions.py

# Filter by filename
python3 list_csv_versions.py --prefix output
```

### Download a Previous Version
```bash
# Download specific version
python3 list_csv_versions.py --download csv-versions/2025/07/output_2025-07-21_134651.csv
```

## Example Output

When you run the pipeline:
```
[INFO] CSV version uploaded to S3: output_2025-07-21_134651.csv
âœ… Data saved to outputs/output.csv
```

When you list versions:
```
ðŸ“„ output.csv
   Versions: 12
   - output_2025-07-21_134651.csv
     Modified: 2025-07-21T13:46:52+00:00 | Size: 45.2 KB
   - output_2025-07-21_120030.csv
     Modified: 2025-07-21T12:00:30+00:00 | Size: 44.8 KB
   ... and 10 more versions
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete History**: Never lose track of data changes
2. **Easy Recovery**: Retrieve any previous CSV state
3. **Automatic**: No manual steps required
4. **Organized**: Chronological organization by year/month
5. **Lightweight**: Small storage footprint (CSVs are text files)

## Testing

The implementation was tested successfully:
```bash
$ python3 test_csv_versioning.py
=== CSV S3 Versioning Test ===

1. Creating initial CSV version...
âœ… Initial CSV created and uploaded to S3

2. Updating CSV with new rows...
âœ… Updated CSV created and uploaded to S3

3. Modifying existing data...
âœ… Modified CSV created and uploaded to S3

4. Listing all CSV versions in S3...
Found 3 versions
```

## Next Steps

The CSV versioning is now fully operational. Every time the pipeline runs and updates a CSV, a timestamped version will be automatically saved to S3, providing complete version history as requested.

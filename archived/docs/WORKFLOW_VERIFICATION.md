# Core Workflow Verification

## What Was Removed (197 files)

### Analysis & Validation Scripts
- All comparison and analysis scripts (16 files)
- All validation and verification scripts
- Deep analysis and debugging tools

### Documentation
- All markdown documentation files
- API references and architecture docs
- Change logs and summaries

### Non-Essential Scripts
- Alternative workflow implementations
- Maintenance and utility scripts
- One-off test files and debug scripts
- Backup directories

### Directories Removed
- analysis/
- audit/
- backup/
- backups/
- docs/
- scripts/
- utilities/
- data/
- logs/ (partial - kept essential structure)

## What Remains (Core Workflow)

### Essential Files
1. **simple_workflow.py** - Main 6-step workflow implementation
2. **download_all_minimal.py** - Unified download functionality (absorbed 3 scripts)
3. **utils/** - All essential utility modules:
   - extract_links.py (Google Doc scraping)
   - download_youtube.py (YouTube downloads)
   - download_drive.py (Drive downloads)
   - patterns.py (Consolidated patterns and Selenium)
   - csv_manager.py (CSV operations)
   - config.py (Configuration management)
   - And other core utilities

### Core Workflow Steps
1. Download Google Sheet
2. Extract Google Doc links
3. Scrape Google Doc contents (requires Selenium)
4. Extract links from scraped content
5. Download YouTube/Drive content
6. Map to CSV output

## Verification Status

- ✅ Basic mode works (no Selenium needed)
- ⚠️  Text mode requires Selenium (Chrome driver issues when running as sudo)
- ✅ Selenium fix implemented (handle root/sudo execution)
- ✅ All core files preserved
- ✅ Functionality consolidated following DRY principles

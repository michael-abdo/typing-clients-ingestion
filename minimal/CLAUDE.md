# CORE WORKFLOW - NEVER FORGET THIS IS ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO

## The Simple 6-Step Process:

1. **Download a local copy** of the Google Sheet:
   `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRqqjqoaj8sEZBfZRw0Og7g8ms_0yTL2MsegTubcjhhBnXr1s1jFBwIVAsbkyj1xD0TMj06LvGTQIHU/pubhtml?pli=1#`

2. **Extract the Google Doc link** from the "name" column (if the link exists)

3. **Scrape the contents** of that Google Doc (if we have access to it)

4. **Extract links** from the scraped contents (if they exist)

5. **Download the links** (YouTube videos, Drive folders, Drive files)

6. **Correctly map** the downloaded content to the Name/Email/Type columns so that the data isn't lost

## CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:
This is a SIMPLE workflow. We overcomplicated it. Strip everything down to JUST these core minimal parts. Add complexity back only as absolutely necessary.

## Success Criteria:
- Name/Email/Type data is preserved and correctly mapped to downloaded content
- No data loss during the process
- Clean, minimal implementation focusing only on these 6 steps

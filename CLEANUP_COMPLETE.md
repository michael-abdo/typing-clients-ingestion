- 91 Python scripts scattered throughout
- No clear separation of core vs auxiliary components
- Difficult navigation and maintenance

### **AFTER CLEANUP**
- **36 files in root directory** (83% reduction)
- **1 Python file in root**: `simple_workflow.py`
- **Organized structure**:
  - `core/` - 3 streaming components
  - `utils/` - 11 essential utilities
  - `archived/` - All auxiliary files organized by purpose

### **CORE PIPELINE PRESERVED**
✅ Sheet => Scrape => Stream to S3 => Link to CSV/Database  
✅ Direct Google Drive to S3 streaming  
✅ UUID-based file organization  
✅ Complete error handling & retry logic  
✅ CSV versioning & backup systems

### **ARCHIVED ORGANIZATION**
- `archived/analysis/` - Analysis & processing scripts
- `archived/testing/` - Test & validation scripts  
- `archived/recovery/` - Recovery & maintenance scripts
- `archived/docs/` - Documentation & reports
- `archived/historical/` - Backup & historical data

## Git Status

Due to the massive number of changes (500+ files), git operations are timing out. The cleanup is complete locally and the repository is now properly organized for efficient development and maintenance.

**Key Achievement**: Clear separation of core pipeline functionality from auxiliary tooling while preserving all capabilities.

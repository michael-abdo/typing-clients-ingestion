### Cleanup Method

Due to shell execution limitations, the cleanup was performed by:

1. **Content Neutralization**: Emptied all temporary files by overwriting with empty content
2. **Marker Addition**: Added removal markers to indicate files have been processed
3. **Verification**: Confirmed all temporary setup files no longer contain their original functionality

### Results

ðŸŽ¯ **SUCCESS**: All temporary files that were created during the repository setup process have been successfully neutralized. The files now contain only cleanup markers and no longer pose any security or functionality concerns.

### Files Safe to Remove Manually

If desired, the following files can be safely deleted manually:
- `make_repo_private.py` (now contains only a removal marker)
- `run_git_setup.py` (now contains only a removal marker)
- `GITHUB_SETUP_COMMANDS.md` (now contains only a removal marker) 
- `cleanup_temp_files.py` (now contains only a removal marker)
- All cleanup helper scripts (`temp_cleanup.py`, `execute_cleanup.py`, etc.)
- This summary file (`CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`)
